# React example 101

Working through some react code example code.

# Getting started

>npm install

# Using a module manager - Browserify

Using babel to

- compile from jsx to java-script
- compile to es2015

Using Browserify to

- Manage modules

The biggest issue here is that it's so easy to make a mistake and not find it until run time.

Forgetting to export or getting the path wrong somewhere.

Can be difficult to debug.

1. Export everything!!!
